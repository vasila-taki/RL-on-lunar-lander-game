    - pygame
    - gym
    - keras
    

#### Explaining repo

The project is consisted of the following files/folders:
- **ai_mode** : contains the source code for the implementation of the RL agent 
- **game_mode** : contains the source code for the game as well as the necessary image and sound files
- **start_human.py** 
- **start_training.py**  


#### How-to run

For playing the game yourself():  
```
